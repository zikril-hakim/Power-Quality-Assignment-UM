# IEEE 14-Bus System Voltage Sag Analysis

This assignment involves the analysis of voltage sag in the IEEE 14-bus system. The main tasks are as follows:

1. **Voltage Sag Calculation**: Calculate the voltage sag at bus 5 and bus 14 when a three-phase fault occurs at each bus in the system. The pre-fault voltage of all buses is given in per unit.

2. **Scenario Analysis**: Repeat the voltage sag calculation under the following conditions:
    - Line 2 – 4 and line 6 – 13 are open-circuited.
    - Generator G3 at bus 3 and G5 at bus 8 are deactivated.

3. **Voltage Event Estimation**: Using the original system conditions, estimate the voltage event under 40% of the nominal 1.0 p.u. for bus 5 and 14 using the given short circuit event per year.

4. **Data Visualization**: Plot a bar chart highlighting the number of voltage sags at bus 4 and 13 according to the sag magnitude level.

5. **Location Analysis**: Based on the results, discuss the suitable place (either bus 5 or 14) to place a factory manufacturing electronic components.

6. **Improvement Suggestion**: Suggest how to improve the voltage at bus 5 or 14 when there is a fault at any location in the system. Justify your suggestion with analytical results.

The assignment requires the use of MATLAB for analysis and the development of a program that can display the voltage sag when a three-phase fault occurs at any bus. A report presenting the analysis results and discussion should be written. The report should not exceed 20 pages and will be assessed for 20% of the overall course marks. The MATLAB codes should be attached to the zipped file.

The report should cover the following aspects:

- Voltage sag calculations under different operating conditions (5%)
- Analysis and discussion of voltage sag results analytically and graphically (5%)
- Suggestion and demonstration of a viable solution to mitigate voltage sag occurrence in the system (5%)
- Provision of a MATLAB code displaying voltage sag results in all cases (5%)

Please note that the use of pictorial illustrations, bar charts, and innovative graphics to illustrate your results is encouraged.
