# IEEE 14-Bus System Voltage Sag Analysis

This assignment involves the analysis of voltage sag in the IEEE 14-bus system. The main tasks are as follows:

1. **Voltage Sag Calculation**: Calculate the voltage sag at bus 5 and bus 14 when a three-phase fault occurs at each bus in the system. The pre-fault voltage of all buses is given in per unit.

2. **Scenario Analysis**: Repeat the voltage sag calculation under the following conditions:
    - Line 2 – 4 and line 6 – 13 are open-circuited.
    - Generator G3 at bus 3 and G5 at bus 8 are deactivated.

3. **Voltage Event Estimation**: Using the original system conditions, estimate the voltage event under 40% of the nominal 1.0 p.u. for bus 5 and 14 using the given short circuit event per year.

4. **Data Visualization**: Plot a bar chart highlighting the number of voltage sags at bus 4 and 13 according to the sag magnitude level.

5. **Location Analysis**: Based on the results, discuss the suitable place (either bus 5 or 14) to place a factory manufacturing electronic components.

6. **Improvement Suggestion**: Suggest how to improve the voltage at bus 5 or 14 when there is a fault at any location in the system. Justify your suggestion with analytical results.
